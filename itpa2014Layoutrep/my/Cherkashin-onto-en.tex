%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Software development technologies evolved from concrete algorithm design and their programmatic implementation to modeling the whole information systems (IS).  The modeling approaches allows developers to describe the system in terms of domain, engineering and software design and features of implementation platforms, and standards of the IS development of a software firm such as programming traditions, used modeling and instrumental tools, etc.  \e{Some more text transit from trends to their real implementations, like Group of a Senior Proggemmer, Extreme and Agile programming. Examples like Django..}

The theoretical basis of the development process is model transformation theories and their software implementations, which are developed in the field of Model Driven Engineering (MDE).  The transformations construct ultimately either source code modules realizing modeled structures or an operator interpretation of models of an intermediate level like virtual machine byte code, SQL queries \e{realization}, and executable UML. \e{\ldots{}}.

In the case if a new IS is being constructed, having already designed and deployed database, Data Driven Engineering (DDE, a kind of MDE) is widely used.  The model of new IS is constructed by importing database structure, e.g. DDL-queries, and adding a semantic layer of the database structure description in IS domain terms.  In laboratory of Complex Information Systems of Institute of System Dynamics and Control Theory at Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, a number of DDE approaches has been developed based on declarative specifications and their run time interpretations, as well as techniques automating the description process.  The interpretation in various aspects allows developer to construct user interface of database modification, subsystem of SQL-queries construction in terms of domain, etc.

The obtained description could be used to extend the capabilities of SQL-query constructor to allow user formulating the query in a natural language, e.g. in Russian, in terms of modeled domain.  In order to do so a new layer of the domain and IS properties description should be devised.  The layer expands the description of the database entities and their relationships with abstract notions of domain and relations, resulting in fibered representation of the domain of two fibers: abstract domain and database structure.  The notions and relations are mapped through the fibers via interpretation.  \e{The layer is based on an ontological description of the domain referencing the terms of the database description.  The layer also is to be reflected to morphological structures of the natural language used to formulate the queries.}

The report describes an approach of such kind of natural question-answering subsystem implementation for IS.  Examples of domain description has been presented for practical problems of municipal management. \e{Some word about the problem...}

\e{In this paper, we continue the development of the approach
\cite{fereferovDiss} within the theoretical aspect \cite{b2:15} of software unified model development, and briefly consider the approach of unification of software modeling and natural language processing.}

\section{A Description of a Database}
\label{sec:description-database}

Data Driven Engineering (DDE) \cite{DDE} one of the powerful direction of Computer science allowing to construct software on the base of data models (data structure description).  Being a part of Model Driven Engineering, DDE inherits its main thesis that software development is a sequence of model transformations starting from abstract models describing information system (IS) in terms of domain \e{and software development process}.

DDE starts either from description of a general view of data structures used by business-logic or from already existing database.  The second case has important value in practice, when customer requires a new implementation of an exiting IS with new features and with conserving exiting data in its warehouse.  ....

The structural description allows developers via transformation to implement routine functionality of IS such as data input forms; user interface and business-logic interaction; import, export and integration operations; etc.  Adding a domain description allows ones to refine user interface with notions familiar to user, as well as construct various query-answering subsystems like SQL-query builders and OLAP operating in terms of domain.

In Institute of System Dynamics and Control Theory at SB RAS a number of DDE technologies has been developed within economic contracts activities supported by some theoretical investigations.  One of the last description format is based on mix of the \texttt{.ini}-file and SQL-query languages.  The first format is used to describe database structure and semantic of attributes and their relations, the second part is used to describe the rules of user interface generation, and interaction with geographical information systems and other applications.

\section{Interpretations of the Description}
\label{sec:interpr-descr}

\subsection{User-Interace Form Generation}
\label{sec:user-interace-form}
One of the important IS quality characteristic is its input forms.  The layouting the widgets in forms is the question of the usability.  From one hand side the widgets must efficiently consume the form area of the form, and from another hand side the user interface must be convenient and fit to the application functionality requirements.

The variation of form size results in relayouting the widgets if the form is aware of the variation.  Various instrumental systems resolves the problem differently.  E.g., in Embarcadero Delphi developer must specify \texttt{align}, \texttt{anchors} and \texttt{autosize} properties to adjust the widgets behavior upon form size change.  The operation must be performed for each widget, and in conditions of entering of a database record of many attributes the adjustment process becomes somewhat problematic.  In addition, layout mechanics of Delphi cannot distribute the size variations between inside widgets proportionally.

The problem is solved in, e.g., open-source widget libraries, like Qt and GTK+.  The widgets are placed in so called containers (which are also a virtual widgets), which manage the order, spacing, padding, fill and expansion properties.  GTK+ widgets could also issue \texttt{size request} message to notify parent widget about required minimal size.  Nevertheless the general engines implemented in the instrumental systems are no aware of the attribute data properties of the IS database.

To account the properties, an rule based engine has been developed on the base of the database description.  ....


In comparison to Microsoft Access the developed layout engine, which also generated user interface on the base of database structure description, the engine ....

OLAP.

\section{Query Builder}
\label{sec:query-builder}


Query constructor of Microsoft Access allows user to design a complex SQL-queries for aggregating and modifying data.  The query builder supports definition of complex conditions for the \texttt{WHERE} and \texttt{HAVING} sections of the query.  The query builder also does not account the domain, and, thus, it is intended for programmers and experienced users accounted with database technologies.  Another problem is the availability of the SQL-query designers for web projects.

% A further development of the project is aimed at implementation of cognitive data mining (data analysis) in similar documents to reveal patterns between attributes that appear in the documents. The results of the analysis may be a basis of automation of document data storage technique decision. For example, if a set of attributes shows a strong correlation to an attribute than it can be interpreted as a relation of a relational database. The set forms a determinant (the key set of a table) and the set of strongly correlated attributes forms rest of the table as described in the Method of Functional Dependency. The method used by database engineers in the process of a database design, the dependencies revealed from the analysis of the attributes’ semantics. That is, the method could be used conversely, the dependencies can be revealed on the base of data mining.
% The abstract layer of information modeling of the knowledge acquisition is a category of system complexes (configurations) \cite{b2:15}, which is perfectly embody common metamodel of the ontologies as well as supply additional structural and functional properties. Developing the theory further one can connect the ontology devised during the document preparation process to the stage of UML-modelling of information system, which automates the processes of the domain.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats

\section{Conclusion}

The nowadays techniques of application software development are aimed at close cooperation of developer and customer.  To shift some responsibility to the customer's users and to extend the maintainability and usability of software, it is necessary to develop a techniques, which produce some processing according to a domain description.  ...

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Software development technologies evolved from concrete algorithm design and their programmatic implementation to modeling the whole information systems (IS).  The modeling approaches allows developers to describe the system in terms of domain, engineering and software design and features of implementation platforms, and standards of the IS development of a software firm such as programming traditions, used modeling and instrumental tools, etc.  \e{Some more text transit from trends to their real implementations, like Group of a Senior Proggemmer, Extreme and Agile programming. Examples like Django..}

The theoretical basis of the development process is model transformation theories and their software implementations, which are developed in the field of Model Driven Engineering (MDE).  The transformations construct ultimately either source code modules realizing modeled structures or an operator interpretation of models of an intermediate level like virtual machine byte code, SQL queries \e{realization}, and executable UML. \e{\ldots{}}.

In the case if a new IS is being constructed, having already designed and deployed database, Data Driven Engineering (DDE, a kind of MDE) is widely used.  The model of new IS is constructed by importing database structure, e.g. DDL-queries, and adding a semantic layer of the database structure description in IS domain terms.  In laboratory of Complex Information Systems of Institute of System Dynamics and Control Theory at Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, a number of DDE approaches has been developed based on declarative specifications and their run time interpretations, as well as techniques automating the description process.  The interpretation in various aspects allows developer to construct user interface of database modification, subsystem of SQL-queries construction in terms of domain, etc.

The obtained description could be used to extend the capabilities of SQL-query constructor to allow user formulating the query in a natural language, e.g. in Russian, in terms of modeled domain.  In order to do so a new layer of the domain and IS properties description should be devised.  The layer expands the description of the database entities and their relationships with abstract notions of domain and relations, resulting in fibered representation of the domain of two fibers: abstract domain and database structure.  The notions and relations are mapped through the fibers via interpretation.  \e{The layer is based on an ontological description of the domain referencing the terms of the database description.  The layer also is to be reflected to morphological structures of the natural language used to formulate the queries.}

The report describes an approach of such kind of natural question-answering subsystem implementation for IS.  Examples of domain description has been presented for practical problems of municipal management. \e{Some word about the problem...}

\e{In this paper, we continue the development of the approach
\cite{fereferovDiss} within the theoretical aspect \cite{b2:15} of software unified model development, and briefly consider the approach of unification of software modeling and natural language processing.}

\section{A Description of a Database/ The Description Language}
\label{sec:description-database}

Data Driven Engineering (DDE) \cite{DDE} one of the powerful direction of Computer science allowing to construct software on the base of data models (data structure description).  Being a part of Model Driven Engineering, DDE inherits its main thesis that software development is a sequence of model transformations starting from abstract models describing information system (IS) in terms of domain \e{and software development process}.

DDE starts either from description of a general view of data structures used by business-logic or from already existing database.  The second case has important value in practice, when customer requires a new implementation of an exiting IS with new features and with conserving exiting data in its warehouse.  ....

The structural description allows developers via transformation to implement routine functionality of IS such as data input forms; user interface and business-logic interaction; import, export and integration operations; etc.  Adding a domain description allows ones to refine user interface with notions familiar to user, as well as construct various query-answering subsystems like SQL-query builders and OLAP operating in terms of domain.

In Institute of System Dynamics and Control Theory at SB RAS a number of DDE technologies has been developed within economic contracts activities supported by necessary theoretical investigations.  One of the last description format is based on mix of the \texttt{.ini}-file and SQL-query languages.  The first format is used to describe database structure and semantic of attributes and their relations, the second part is used to describe the rules of user interface generation, and interaction with geographical information systems and other applications.

\subsection{Developing IS with Specifications}
\label{sec:descr-synth-stag}

In a general case on the first stage of IS development, system engineer carries on structural analysts of the domain, resulting in description of concepts and their basic relations, business-processes and software requirements.  After that, the database design follows, which produces database schema ad its implementation as database server.  Common design tools (such as Sybase Power Designer, IBM Rational Rose) are used on this stage.

On the third stage model of IS is constructed by loading the implemented database schema and extending it with the description of the following special database object classes: \texttt{table}, \texttt{view}, \texttt{rule}, and so called \texttt{superstructure}.  The \texttt{table} objects describe IS database structure and relations, attribute data types and names.  These object are automatically constructed by loading and analyzing IS database schema, if it is literally devised (it must be at least in third normal form).  The lack of schemata data is compensated manually with \e{the description language} and the following interpretation.

The \texttt{view} objects are more complicated than \texttt{tables} and used to generate user interface.  Here we define properties of the relation, for example, for each foreign key a loookup widget can be used to select a  record from a foreign table (a reference book).  For complex reference book and transitive references, the identification attribute set bust be specified to increase generated user interface usability.  There are other special cases of foreign key interpretations, like ``master-details'', and all of them can be specified with \e{the description language}.

The \texttt{superstructure} objects support interaction of developed IS with foreign modules and libraries processing information with methods beyond the standard of rational databases and SQL, e.g., computer simulation and complex data visualizations.

%\hangindent=\parindent%\hangafter=1
The \texttt{rules} objects are responsible for specific to business-processes functions implementation in generated IS.  By means of the rules, one can describe input field logic (enabling and disabling them), implement uniqueness check routines and \e{PD} interaction, i.e., rules provide declarative means of describing and implementing relationships between in business-logic layer of IS.  The rules also affect the generated queries to IS database during editing and creating special widgets in user interface, which connect input data with spatial tables and render cartographic.

\e{For all the object classes a formal set model is devised.  We will not describe it in this paper, ...}

On the forth stage the IS is generated as a result of the description interpretation.  It integrates according to the rules the foreign software subsystems. \e[blue]{Should we describe the rules of interface generation in details ?}

\subsection{The Description Language}

... The language has LL(1) grammar class.  Its syntactic structures describe elements of IS and a general options like database connection properties.  The specifications written in the language are \emph{precise}, \emph{understandable} and \emph{complete} according to [1,2].  The language clauses have the following general structure:

\begin{asdcode}%
<Start keyword> <List of mandatory statements> [~list of optional statements~]
\end{asdcode}

The \texttt{start keyword} can be one of the following: \texttt{ADO}, \texttt{BDE}, \texttt{CFG}, \texttt{Table}, \texttt{View}, \texttt{Plugins}, \texttt{Uses}, \texttt{Include}, \texttt{Menu}.  First two are used to describe properties of database connection.  Keyword \texttt{CFG} used to describe general application settings of IS.  Keywords \texttt{Table}, \texttt{View} describe the database schema and view widgets.  Keyword \texttt{Plugins} describes interaction with outer systems, \texttt{Uses} and \texttt{Include} allow developer to break an IS description into source modules.  Keyword \texttt{Menu} controls the main menu of IS application.

Let's consider a part of an example description.

\begin{lstlisting}
TABLE ADR FOR SP_ADDR AS 'Address' READONLY
\end{lstlisting}

This statement describes table \texttt{SP\_ADR} of IS, the table is renamed as \texttt{ADR} for usage in the rest of the description. The table will have alias \texttt{'Address'} in user interface forms.  The following language construction describes table fields.

\begin{lstlisting}
FIELDS (ID_BUIL_G P AS 'Building Code',
        ID_NREG ^SP_NREG AS 'Region Code',
 ID_MK_GM ^SP_MK_GM AS 'Microdistrict Code',
        ID_STREET ^vSP_STR AS 'Street Code',
        BUIL=S AS 'Building',
        ANN=S AS 'Annotation);
\end{lstlisting}

Identifiers \texttt{ID\_*}, \texttt{BUIL} and \texttt{Ann} are table fields.  Sign \texttt{\^} creates a reference to a table or a view, in particular, \texttt{\^{}SP\_NREG} is a table referenced by field \texttt{ID\_NREG}, and \texttt{\^{}vSP\_STR} is a reference to a view.  Expression \texttt{ANN=S} denotes \texttt{ANN} to be a string field.  In the first line \texttt{ID\_BUIL P} denotes that the field is a key field.

\e{[[Is this necessary? p46]]In addition to the references, there are \texttt{REFS(\ldots)} construction that allows one to define references of various types including ``master-details'' (\texttt{DR}).}











\section{Interpretations of the Description}
\label{sec:interpr-descr}

\e[gray]{Describe a general approach to interpretation process.}

\subsection{User-Interace Form Generation}
\label{sec:user-interace-form}
One of the important IS quality characteristic is its input forms.  The layouting the widgets in forms is the question of the usability.  From one hand side the widgets must efficiently consume the form area of the form, and from another hand side the user interface must be convenient and fit to the application functionality requirements.

The variation of form size results in relayouting the widgets if the form is aware of the variation.  Various instrumental systems resolves the problem differently.  E.g., in Embarcadero Delphi developer must specify \texttt{align}, \texttt{anchors} and \texttt{autosize} properties to adjust the widgets behavior upon form size change.  The operation must be performed for each widget, and in conditions of entering of a database record of many attributes the adjustment process becomes somewhat problematic.  In addition, layout mechanics of Delphi cannot distribute the size variations between inside widgets proportionally.

The problem is solved in, e.g., open-source widget libraries, like Qt and GTK+.  The widgets are placed in so called containers (which are also a virtual widgets), which manage the order, spacing, padding, fill and expansion properties.  GTK+ widgets could also issue \texttt{size request} message to notify parent widget about required minimal size.  Nevertheless the general engines implemented in the instrumental systems are no aware of the attribute data properties of the IS database.

To account the properties, an rule based engine has been developed on the base of the database description.  ....


In comparison to Microsoft Access the developed layout engine, which also generated user interface on the base of database structure description, the engine ....

\paragraph{Database Editor}



\subsection{Query Builder}
\label{sec:query-builder}


Query constructor of Microsoft Access allows user to design a complex SQL-queries for aggregating and modifying data.  The query builder supports definition of complex conditions for the \texttt{WHERE} and \texttt{HAVING} sections of the query.  The query builder also does not account the domain, and, thus, it is intended for programmers and experienced users accounted with database technologies.  Another problem is the availability of the SQL-query designers for web projects.



\subsection{On-Line Analitical Processing}
\label{sec:olap}

The IS description used to implement import routines for On-Line Analitical Processing unit (OLAPu).  The unit allows user to store, select and analyze numberic indicators.  The indicators are considered as funtions of a set of attributes.  OLAPu can
selected the indicators in various projection combinations.

OLAPu's design is classic client-server architecture, where server is a rational data storage, and client provide a flexible access to the indicator data by means of intuitive user interface.  The interface is configured specially to support the munidimentional OLAP.  The user by means of widgets of the interface selects and ajusts projection and indicator aggregation configuration, the results of the configuration are presented ast interactive tables and can be stored in Microdoft Excel spreadsheet pages.

To convert IS data {table}, {view} and {superstructure} objects are used.  The data converts into a tree of indicators.  Each node of tree correspond data selected in a projection.  Each projection characterizes with a set of attributes.  The sets are reffered as dimentions.  They could describe regions, industries, types of ownership, etc.  A special case of the dimentions is time intervals, such as year, half a year, quartal, month.  Most of the indicators are tied with time intervals.

The indicator data usually have more complex structure than just a linearly ordered set.  The set usually is a tree structure, where one inidcator aggregates data of a set of subordinal indicators, e.g., state indicator aggregates state regional data.  The same is true for industries.  The indicators are stored in indicator value tables.  The table includes all the index dimension attribute references to the tables of the IS database and the index value itself.

\begin{figure}[bt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MDA-olap.png}
  \caption{Main window of OLAP unit}
  \label{fig:olapu}
\end{figure}

The main windows of OLAP unit is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:olapu}.  The window has been divided on two parts.  The upper part consist of three panels with dimension lists, and the lower part is the resulting table.  User must select an indicator from the left list of dimensions as well as the dimensions associated with columns and rows of the resulting table.  The headers of rows and columns may contain combinations of dimensions.  In this case for all the combination a row (column) is inserted into the resulting table widget.  The combinations of dimensions and attribute value filters are adjusted by mouse click on the tables.

The time intervals are selected with special pop up dialog widget on mouse click.  User can drag dimensions between lists and reorder them, this results in regeneration of the resulting table.  When editing is allowed, user can change values of indicators directly in the resulting table cells.  The changes are immediately stored into the original database of IS.  The table widget allows export data and table structure into system clipboard in a table format recognizable by Microsoft Excel, the same is implemented in the opposite direction.

\section{Usage Example: GeoAW}
\label{sec:usage-gis}

The developed technologies are applied in GeoAW (Geological Automatized Workplace) environment, which is aimed at construction of GIS for municipal authorities.  Its derivative GIS systems allow one to represent data accumulated in departments as GIS cartographic.  In order to construct such system developers must go through the steps described early to describe data sources and filter data to be represented in new GIS applications.  The main attention should be paid to spatial related attributes, as the attributes are used in connecting the table rows and graphics shapes of topographic base.

GeoAW environment is an instrumental tool to create stand-alone Windows GIS applications.  Its architecture is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}.  GeoAW consists of the following main software components: Specification Management,  System Kernel, Database Editor, user Query Builder, Plugin Interface, and GIS as external application.

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


\section{Conclusion}

The nowadays techniques of application software development are aimed at close cooperation of developer and customer.  To shift some responsibility to the customer's users and to extend the maintainability and usability of software, it is necessary to develop a techniques, which produce some processing according to a domain description.  ...
